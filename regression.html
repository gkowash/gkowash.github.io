      <h1>Multivariate linear regression algorithm from scratch</h1>

      <p>
        This page describes my process in writing a basic linear regression
        algorithm in Python. I've been working through a machine learning
        course on Coursera, but it's unfortunately lacking in hands-on projects,
        so I thought this would be a good supplement.

      <h2>Basics of linear regression</h2>
      <p>
        Regression is a machine learning technique that aims to approximate some
        relationship within a dataset using a linear function.
